- Live Site URL: [Netlify URL](https://stats-challenge-amanda.netlify.app/)

## My process

1. Made a Github Repo
2. Look at the screenshot and understand the layout and design of it.
3. Gather font and color and apply it to the HTML and CSS
4. Make the site look as close as the screenshot as possible
5. Launch it on Netlify

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- BootStrap 4

### What I learned

I learned to see the design and recreate the site. It was my first time recreating a design by someone's else. I also learned how to deploy a site on Netlify.

### Continued development

I would like to focus more on the mobile version of it. I attempted a few times, and each time it wasn't coming out the way I wanted. I would rather get back in shape programming (Get back into more of a routine) than being stuck on a simple issue.
